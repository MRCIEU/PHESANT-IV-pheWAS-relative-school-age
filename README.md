# IV-pheWAS of relative school age

We have conducted a hypothesis-free analysis, searching for the potential effects of relative school age.


## 1. Data preparation

Prepare the exposure variables, and confounder file. The two exposure variables are:

1. A binary variable of those born in August versus those born in September (i.e. restricting to participants born in these months).
2. A set of indicator variables describing the month of birth of each participant.

See `1-data_preparation` directory.

## 2. Run PHESANT

We run IV-pheWAS for the two instrumental variables described above.

See `2-PHESANT` directory.

## 3. Follow-up analyses

See `3-FollowUp directory.
